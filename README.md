# toadTrack
Program to locate and track toads from a sequence of depth images.

The images running through the program must already be ripped from whatever RGB-D camera the user recorded depth from, such as the Kinect for Windows v2. The program utilizes the OpenCV library, segmenting the background, and creating a foreground mask to locate moving objects. This program was created for the Robotics and Computer Vision Lab at Fordham University.
